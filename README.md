## Flask Application Design

**Problem Statement:**
> Design a multi-agent system where a swarm of robots can collectively build a structure. The robots should be able to coordinate their actions, navigate the environment, and adapt to changing conditions. The structure should be designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for different configurations and sizes.

**Design:**

### **HTML Files**
- **index.html:**
    - Provides the user interface for controlling the swarm and building the structure.
    - Contains buttons, inputs, and a visualization area to display the swarm and the structure.

- **status.html:**
    - Displays the current status of the swarm, including the number of active robots, the progress of the structure, and any errors encountered.

### **Routes**
- **/:**
    - Main route that serves the index.html file.

- **status**:
    - Serves the status.html file, providing real-time updates on the swarm's progress.

- **start**:
    - Initiates the swarm and starts the building process.

- **stop**:
    - Halts the swarm and stops the building process.

- **reset**:
    - Resets the swarm and the structure, allowing for new configurations.

- **coordinates**:
    - Receives coordinates from the user interface and sends them to the swarm for navigation and structure construction.

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Communication:** Robots in the swarm communicate using a publish-subscribe message broker.
- **Navigation:** Robots use a pathfinding algorithm to navigate the environment and avoid obstacles.
- **Modular Design:** The structure is composed of modular components that can be assembled and reconfigured to create different shapes and sizes.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to accommodate a large number of robots, allowing for swarm expansion as needed.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

- **Collision Avoidance:** Robots may collide with each other or with obstacles. The pathfinding algorithm is designed to minimize collisions, and the robots are equipped with sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
- **Dynamic Environment:** The environment may change dynamically, such as obstacles being added or removed. The robots can adapt to these changes by updating their pathfinding algorithm in real-time.
- **Swarm Coordination:** Coordinating a large number of robots can be challenging. The publish-subscribe messaging system enables efficient communication and coordination among the robots.
